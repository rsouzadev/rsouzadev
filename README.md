- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rsouzadev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development!
- ABOUT ME:
* I am a flexible, reliable, enthusiastic, self-motivated, responsible, and hard-working person. I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all challenging situations. I can work well both in a team environment as well as using my own initiative.
* I started my career in 2001 after having lived in the United States for 2 years, working firstly as an intern and as the time passed in the following areas: Import Assistant, Customer Service Analyst, Import and Export Analyst, Air and Sea Import Assistant and International Traffic Coordinator, always focusing on the freight forwarding segment. In parallel, I worked as an English Teacher and as a Translator, professions which I still perform after working hours or on weekends. 
* I always wanted to work in the Information Technology area. In 1998 I started a technician high school in Data Processing, but as I had an unmissable opportunity to study in the United States, I had to stop the course the following year because I prioritized learning the English language. When I returned to Brazil 2 years later, I ended up getting involved in the Foreign Trade Industry, a remarkably interesting area, a profession which I performed from 2001 to 2015. 
* From 2015 to 2021 I continued to develop my career as an English Teacher and as a Translator. In the same year, I got the long-awaited opportunity to enter the Information Technology field. This transition was not easy for me as this change happened recently during the pandemic and I was 37 years old with 2 children...Well, it was very challenging and that was a little bit of my story! ðŸŒ± Nowadays I am currently studying and following a roadmap: Logic and Algorithms, HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript.
